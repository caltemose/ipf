        h1 Getting to the Inman Park Festival
        
        p As those of you who visit our neighborhood regularly know, parking in Inman Park is becoming a bit more difficult. We strongly encourage you to avoid parking in Inman Park or in the adjacent neighborhoods. Please consider using any of the following options instead of driving directly here:
        
        ul
            li Walk/bike the beltline if you can - it's really the best way to get here 
            li Marta to the Inman Park/Reynoldstown Station
            li Drive to a Marta station near Inman Park (Edgewood/Candler Park, East Lake) and then take Marta just 1 or 2 stops to our station
            li Lyft/Uber/Taxi

        //- h2 Bike

        //- p Free and secure valet bike parking will be provided by the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition in the alley off Delta Place near the Delta Park Stage and on the eastern side of the neighborhood at Euclid Avenue and Waverly Way.
