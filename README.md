# Inman Park Festival Website

This is the repo for the redone/redesigned/slimmed-down Inman Park Festival website at http://inmanparkfestival.org.

It uses a gulp-based front-end workflow that is based on the [Viget Labs Gulp Starter repo](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter). The key difference is I'm using Jade instead of Nunjucks for templating.
